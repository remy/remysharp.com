# remy sharp's b:log

This code is 100% bespoke, partially inspired by [11ty](https://11ty.io) and by [Harp](http://harpjs.com/).

A few notes:

- Dates in blog posts are UTC (this bugs me, but it's necessary)
- Only the `public` directory is published
- Blog posts exist in `public/blog`
- Blog posts can be scheduled by using a future date, or specifically marked as draft
