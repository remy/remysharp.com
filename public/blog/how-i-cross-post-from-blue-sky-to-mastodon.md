Since leaving Twitter I've _sort of_ straddled myself across [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/remysharp.com) and [Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@rem) - but find that I generally sit in the land of BlueSky the most and as much as I want to share my brainfarts across as much of the web as possible, my Mastodon account would often lose out.

So this is the process I'm now using to ensure fresh posts on BlueSky always end up.
