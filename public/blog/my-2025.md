# My 2025



<!--more-->

## Looking back at 2024 and then this year

I've just read through my opening to the [end of 2024](https://remysharp.com/2024/12/31/my-2024) and wow, it doesn't feel better (to me). Though I do appreciate two things that factor into this: 1. I'm a glass half empty fella, 2. the coverage (I follow) of events doesn't often highlight the positive things happening.

The world is on fire. Still.

With this particular phrase in mind, I saw The Holdovers last week for the first time, and [this quote](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14849194/quotes/?item=qt7172147) struck me, for a movie set in 1970:

> the world doesn't make sense anymore. I mean, it's on fire. The rich don't give a shit. Poor kids are cannon fodder. Integrity is a punch line. Trust is just a name on a bank.

The response to which is:

> …if that's all true, then now is when they most need someone like you.

I think that's why we need to still feel like it's burning so that we can find that fire and help as do what we/I can.

Two particular legal cases that I'm trying to follow (though struggling because I suspect these legal things are _slow_):

- Palatine Action having been [proscribed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Action#Proscription), and the [legal challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Action#Legal_challenge), at time of writing, ["Judgment is awaited"](https://gcnchambers.co.uk/final-submissions-made-before-judgment-in-high-court-challenge-to-proscription-of-palestine-action/).
- The ECHR "interim guidance" (quoted due to the lack-thereof) on "woman" and "sex" refer to the biological sex - and the resulting [challenge](https://goodlawproject.org/case/were-challenging-the-ehrcs-interim-guidance/) showing that it's transphobic and legally wrong.

A few other highlights being Labour did not swoop in and do what I had hoped (i.e. do right by people) and instead has spent a lot of their time trying to out-Reform Reform. The Giant Cheese Puff across the pond is tearing apart democracy, [literally and figuratively](https://youtu.be/dergOG7vpJg?si=Oq5VTYDcVAhs3laO&t=105) and the [genocide continues](https://www.aljazeera.com/search/genocide?sort=date) even after a "ceasefire" and the [far right continue to raise it's ugly head](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/29/number-people-britons-must-be-born-in-uk-rising-study) in the UK.

So… with that floating around in the background, I have found it hard to find the motivation to care about the web, about bits of code and about writing on my blog.

I will say that I've found a little light in the political sphere. I regularly watch [Pod Save the UK](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-the-uk/) on YouTube, and found Zack Polanski's campaign to lead the greens - and _a lot_ of what I believed. I've joined the Greens specifically to cast a vote and not only did he win, but the Greens have seen a huge surge adding over 120,000 new members (me included).

In a similar vein to doom scrolling, I found myself watching Polanski's videos and interviews online to drop a pipette's worth of hope back into my system. This was a [particular highlight](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4nNJYpHk6Co) for me earlier this year.

With that out of the way, what have I been up to?

## Work

Work-work (or as most people know it: _paid work_) has really been two main items: working with [Oak National](https://www.thenational.academy/) and working on FFConf 2025.

I first started working for Oak in early 2021 and have worked with them for just over 3 years in total. Ranging from rebuilding their question and answer system, to designing and building their public facing content API (where you, Jo Public, can access any part of their curriculum).

I really like working with the people at Oak, and it's the first place I encountered the concept of working in squads (which I see as like mini movie production crews - ask me in person what I mean!).

My last contract ended in mid-August this year, but I'm looking forward to returning to work with them at the start of 2026.

Then onto FFConf, and with my Oak contract ending, allowed me much more time to focus on the event, planning and new software.

### FFConf

This year's lead up to FFconf was very, very different to 2024's lead up.

In 2024, the stress of trying to sell tickets, trying to find sponsors, and feeling like we were spinning our tyres and getting no-where was bad. Very, very bad. Like "I want to throw this all in"-bad.

When Julie and I returned to FFConf's planning for 2025 we knew this wasn't the last one, but we also knew we needed to do something different at the very least for my own mental health (and so Julie wasn't worried about me the whole year).

The relatively small and simple change we made was that we decided we would send a newsletter every week. The same structure, but weekly on Thursday.

This seemingly obvious change, completely changed the experience for me. There was none of the stress and terror that I experienced in 2024.

Weirdly, tickets sold _mostly_ similarly to 2024, but it _felt_ completely different.

As for the day. It was wonderful. I had a smile throughout the day, and I felt full of love from the people who attended. The talks were amazing and inspiring and fun. I [wrote about the day](https://remysharp.com/2025/11/22/ffconf-2025) too.

## Projects

As I mentioned earlier, I've gone through a lot of the year not entirely excited about web stuff. I want to be, but… I'm just not right now.

A side effect of that feeling is that I've not really put much out into the world. I know I don't have to, but I also know that it's my creative outlet, and it's a nice thing for me to do (for me).

AI has been a dominant feature of the tech industries in 2025 - [unavoidable](https://bsky.app/profile/remysharp.com/post/3mavgppf5bc2k) in a lot of cases - but I have been dabbling in lots of little personal tools and toys using (effectively) vibe coding.

I find myself using this vibe coding method to create personal items that make something really specific to me, like: a tracker to help me and Julie to remember who chose the movie last week _and_ what the hell we watched, or, a command line tool to scan my network and try to work out where my [esphome](https://esphome.io/) devices are, or, a percentage calculate (because I _keep_ forgetting how it works), or, a tool to modify subtitle files to offset the timing, or, a stupid toy that let's me upload a photo, cut out a mouth, then it uses speech API to sing whatever you type in.

[But these are personal toys](https://remysharp.com/2025/07/18/vibe-coding-and-robocop). Prototypes. Things that are not meant for more than one user.

I'd like to list and screenshot some of these in the future to preserve them a little better.

### Donations

Each year, since 2021, I've been trying to look at donating _at least_ 10% of the business profits to charities.

I put a call out on socials for anyone's lived experience with any trans support charities and the replies grew and grew (as much as I wanted to give to them all, I simply couldn't).

When reviewing which charities to donate to, we always check their income and want to see that they're also using their funds.

- [Choir with No Name](https://www.choirwithnoname.org/) - homelessness and marginalised groups
- [Forward Facing](https://www.forwardfacing.co.uk/) - support for families with critical illness or complex disabilities
- [The Clare Project](https://clareproject.org.uk/) - support for trans, non-binary and intersex adults

Separately, I also donated to these companies (which aren't charities) from my personal donations:

- [Trans Kids Deserve Better](https://transkidsdeservebetter.org/)
- [TransActual](https://transactual.org.uk/)
- [The Good Law Project](https://goodlawproject.org/)

I hope to continue this "tradition" while I can.
