# To gist and back again

I've recently been using [gists](https://gist.github.com) to help debug user issues on nodemon. The process is two parts: firstly getting the original files up into a gist (ideally pared down), and secondly downloading each file to my local dev environment.

Using two tools, I'm able to simplify this workflow pretty nicely, so I can go to gist and back again.

## Caveats first

For the time being, directory structure is not supported, which is a bit of a limitation, but perhaps something like the `tree` command mixed in with the tree generation command (I wrote) called [eert](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eert) could help.

## Up: to gist

To get files online, you _could_ upload them individually to the gist website, or better than that: install the `gist` [command line tool](https://github.com/defunkt/gist#installation).

For Mac users, I'd recommend using the `brew install gist` (and get brew, the package installer from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/)). Otherwise, `gem install gist` (though my own track record for using `gem installâ€¦` is fairly shaky, so hopefully you have more luck).

Then you specify the files to send up:

```bash
$ gist index.js package.json
https://gist.github.com/a24b93601b8b2a68b8e978460bf6e4e1
```

That URL can/should be then shared on the issue.

## Down: from gist

Now for the fun part, pulling a gist down and generating all the individual files in a single command ðŸ’ªðŸ˜ƒ

Using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor), a well formed command can use Github's public API for reading gist (though won't work on secret gists unless you also use an auth tokenâ€¦outta scope for this post though).

First, here's the full working command (assuming you've installed `jq` and you have `curl` on your machine - most do):

```bash
$ eval "$(curl -L https://git.io/vbSgz \
  | jq -r '.files
  | to_entries
  | .[].value
  | @sh "echo \(.content) > \(.filename)"')"
$ tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

### What's actually happening?

The `jq` is given a "script" to run against the JSON result of the gist API call. You can play with an [interactive jq toy I built](https://jace.isthe.link/#!/a24b93601b8b2a68b8e978460bf6e4e1?query=.files%20%7C%20to_entries%20%7C%20.%5B%5D.value%20%7C%20@sh%20%22echo%20%5C%28.content%29%20%3E%20%5C%28.filename%29%22) and see the effects of tweaking the query.

To explain the query:

* [`.files`](https://jace.isthe.link/#!/a24b93601b8b2a68b8e978460bf6e4e1?query=.files): reads the `files` property.
* [`to_entries`](https://jace.isthe.link/#!/a24b93601b8b2a68b8e978460bf6e4e1?query=.files%20%7C%20to_entries): transforms the objects into an array that exposes the property from each unique filename into a common property name.
* [`.[].value`](https://jace.isthe.link/#!/a24b93601b8b2a68b8e978460bf6e4e1?query=.files%20%7C%20to_entries%20%7C%20.%5B%5D.value): returns a list (not an array) of objects that contain the filename and contents for plucking.
* [`@sh "echo \(.content) > \(.filename)"`](https://jace.isthe.link/#!/a24b93601b8b2a68b8e978460bf6e4e1?query=.files%20%7C%20to_entries%20%7C%20.%5B%5D.value%20%7C%20@sh%20%22echo%20%5C%28.content%29%20%3E%20%5C%28.filename%29%22): generates a "shell safe" string that is the `echo` command piped into a file as named by the `.filename` property in our object. The `\(.<prop>)` syntax is the template syntax for jq.

This query is passed to `jq -r` - the `-r` part returns the result as a bare string (rather than quoted as you'll see the result in the Jace tool links).

Finally the **entire** result is `eval`ed through the command line which is the same as copying and pasting each line into the command line.

The result: individual files with the contents from the gists.
