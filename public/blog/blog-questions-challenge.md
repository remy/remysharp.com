# Blog Questions Challenge

I remember seeing something very similar doing the rounds on that site we used to use called "Twitter", possibly back in 2007. Anyway, fast forward a full grown adult and it's making the rounds, except this time instead of looking dough eyed from afar, that lovely man [Stuart](https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2025/02/03/blog-questions-challenge/) tagged me (though arguably Jeremy also tagged [everyone](https://youtu.be/74BzSTQCl_c?si=hxm1WKV0_zIw6vT_&t=9) in [his post](https://adactio.com/journal/21674) too).

So here's my hat in the ring.

<!--  -->

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I'd had a couple of false starts with blogging. Once in 2004 during a 3 month sabbatical in Whistler, Canada to keep friends & family up to date with my activities. That last 3 weeks (on Google's blogger platform - no idea if it still exists).

After getting back to the UK, whilst I was working full time in London (and travelling back home to Brighton), I decided that I would start my own business, and that like any good web based business, developer thingy person, I **should** have a blog. Literally as simple as that.

Since I had no one to write for, and nothing to say, I started just writing little movie reviews of films I'd seen at the cinema and little notes that I thought were interesting things happening on the web (technically this was [my first blog post](https://remysharp.com/2006/09/01/flickr-geo-tags) on remysharp.com even though I back-posted one to before then).

Simultaneously at around the same time, I was blogging on leftlogic.com which had a handful of high traffic posts (like my [Microformats bookmarklet](https://web.archive.org/web/20061018170535/http://leftlogic.com/info/articles/microformats_bookmarklet)), that eventually I brought some of the posts across to this blog (I should really move the rest in one day).

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?

Today my blog is a custom rolled static site generator (SSG) written in JavaScript. It's [on github](https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com) if you want a peek. Because the site is entirely static (with some dynamic content either regenerated on build or if I run an offline command), it means I host my site on Netlify (thanks Netlify folks).

Before that I was running my blog on a SSG called [Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp), and this was hosted on Heroku. It based a lot of the inspiration for my own code (along with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), though I didn't use it for my personal blog).

Before that, and originally, it was WordPress. Mostly because I could get started on the blogging side rather than get too bogged down in how comments and [pingbacks](https://indieweb.org/pingback) work. I've literally no idea where that was hosted, but I moved away from WordPress when I'd hit my limit of viagra adverts being injected into various vulnerabilities that WordPress so kindly hosted for me.

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that's part of your blog?

As markdown in whatever editor I happen to be using at the time. I'm writing this in VS Code, and if I'm at my desktop machine, it's likely the "editor" I'll use.

If I'm on my phone (and I've written _a lot_ of posts on my phone, on a treadmill), it'll be iA Writer for Android.

I don't have any fancy formatting, and I've gotten the sense that for a lot of the bloggers who've written similar posts, they're in the same boat.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

There's two distinct times:

When there's an immediate trigger in front of me. This could be a technical problem that I thought would be useful to write up (so that I can search my own blog for the solution), or if there's some opinion on the web that I strongly want to leap on and have my say in (yes, though I won't admit it, I suspect I love the sound of my own words, I mean, look how long this post is already).

Those posts tend to be easier to write.

The other time is when I'm either in bed trying to sleep, or in bed trying not to get up, or driving and my brain is on idle. I find myself wanting to write about much more nuanced subjects, like for instance: how AI might affect the coders jobs and how that might impact children today. But inevitably they're subjects that I'm not confident to articulate and I pontificate instead ("articulate" and "pontificate" in a single blog post, 13 year old Rem would be proud, and slightly grossed out).

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

Always immediately after. Otherwise they go to die a slow death in my [drafts](https://remysharp.com/drafts/) - which I should really just go ahead and rename to _purgatory_.

The problem I now face having run my blog for 19 years (so far!), is that I don't tend to fart out posts as quickly. Ironically I've written about [why I don't write](https://remysharp.com/2021/11/21/why-i-write-and-when-i-dont#why-i-wont-write) and what blocks me in particular. The thing that slows me down (a lot) is needing to make sure I'm being as technically accurate as possible. Checking for bugs or misunderstandings, which then leads to rabbit holes, which, quite a few times, leads to purgatory (sorry, "permanent draft").

## What's your favourite post on your blog?

I'm not entirely sure I have one. I'm very proud of [my series on JS Bin](https://remysharp.com/2015/09/14/jsbin-toxic-part-1) (originally a single blog post at over well over 5,000 words, I was advised to break it up!). My series of posts when we [returned to CERN to build](https://remysharp.com/2019/02/12/cern-day-1) the World Wide Web browser was fun too.

I'm also fairly keen on my post on [you're paying to speak](https://remysharp.com/2014/03/07/youre-paying-to-speak) - because I _still_ feel strongly about it and it's still relevant (and did kick off some good discussion).

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

I'm regularly thinking on the backend of the blog, making slight build speed improvements, or having to fix or add some little thing. I briefly thought about adding a section on the games I'm playing and completing, but it turns out I'm pretty crap at games, so the list quickly ended at three games and hit the bin.

In short: no.

## Next?

Although I love you, my dear reader, very much, I'm going to tag a few people who's blogs pop into my head. The first is [Ana Rodrigues](https://ohhelloana.blog/posts/). Next would be the lovely [Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/) who, if he does blog on this one will be off brand from the mega technical posts! Finally, [Charlie O'Hara](https://awfulwoman.com/) (aka Whale Coiner and all kinds of other names) - I'm sure Charlie's had multiple blogs, but not sure enough to bet on it, so it'll be nice to (hopefully) read her history on this too.

There's lots more people that I'd love to read their history, but I think it would be rude to snag them all for my own. Definitely looking forward to reading more of these posts from people.
