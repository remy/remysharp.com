I'll never tire of how bored the Murderbot is!

I've read every one of the Murderbot diaries and have always enjoyed the fresh take on a bot that's painted in world where people distrust them by default, and yet the Murderbot would rather avoid eye contact, shy away and watch their streaming TV series on their own.

As the books have evolved, it's fun that Murderbot knows that I'm reading their diary and often breaks the "fourth wall" to speak to us, or share how they'd much rather be doing something else.

In a way, Murderbot reminds me of many geek developers who'd rather stay indoors, hide from the sun, complain about other humans and generally prefer their own company.
