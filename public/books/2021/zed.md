summary: "A good read, rather on the nose as to the BS that exists in tech"
---

The book starts out really well and strong. Though I wasn't entirely sure who I was supposed to be plumping for, each character had their own sadness.

There's a tech background to the book that I've seen face to face, not the AI/sentient bits, but the constant tracking *and* the BS fobbing off that people in tech (who mostly don't understand their tech) use. Certainly for the first half of the book I found myself chuckling away.

The story and outlook is pretty bleak: all privacy lost, super corp tracks your every move and uses that information to then manipulate your decisions. Pretty much what we face today, in the early 20s, with Google and Facebook.

For me, I felt like the book started to lose its momentum around halfway and it felt like the story was stagnating. I wasn't really sure how the antagonist actually ties up with the story, or even if indeed the _were_ the/an antagonist.

It also felt to me like it ended abruptly without really being able to say anything. Which might be because we already like in a world where super corp does indeed hold our privacy to random and there's really no escaping it _and_ even then in the face of criminal behaviour (see Brexit campaign and Trump) there's no recourse that the either the law can apply or society seems to want to see actioned. That's to say: it's pretty messed up.
