After I got used to the technical aspect of the writing, a really engrossing story.

The book is written in a way that quite often ends right in the middle of a train of thought. Reading on a kindle it was hard to work out if it was intentional or if there was a problem with the Kindle edition! After a while I got used to it, and learnt to just to either let go of the sentiment or ignore it.

The story uses time jumping *a lot* ,but thankfully the book is written in a way that it was easy to know when we had jumped back or forwards through time.

The story is set in a dystopian alternative reality, which frankly isn't far from our reality now and it's easy to see how our society could get there. Which makes the entire story even more scary.

The story primarily follows Theo Miller a person who has lived in the world as it becomes worse and just gone along with it because "that's just the way the world works".

He weighs crime for indemnity, of course rape has a power indemnity than sexual harassment (becauseâ€¦ Men made the rules)
