Fine. Easy read. Guessed the murdered though 🤷

Grabbed it for the Christmas period (slightly annoyed I finished it on Jan 2nd). It's decently written, apparently part of a series (this being book 6) but stands fine on it's own. There's a few references to something that happened before, but doesn't affect the story.

It does read like a Columbo or Murder She Wrote, where there's people killing other people like it's just another Wednesday. All ends are fully tied up without anything left to the reader by the end.

I did figure out the killer around 1/3rd of the way in - or at least I keep asking the protagonist "What about X?!".

Not terribly Christmasy, but the very last chapter was very sweet.
