Cats…sentient cats.

A fun, good length book that doesn't take itself too seriously (which, sentient cats is probably the first clue).

On reflection (and since the blurb already gives this away), the "hyperintelligent talking spy cats" are a core mechanic of the story, I do now wonder why _they_ hadn't turned out to be the super villains? I'm pretty sure the first thing smart cats would do is ship humans off to a petting zoo as soon as they had the kind of skills the cats in this book does…

Minor plot hole aside, I enjoyed this story. Very light weight on the brain, pretty silly without being utterly stupid, and manages to end up in a sensible place.

A recommend if you want something to bridge between some heavy reading.
