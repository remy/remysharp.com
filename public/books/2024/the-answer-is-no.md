Brief, sadly, on all aspects.

I knew this was a short read, and having come out of Frank Herbert's Dune at almost 900 pages, a nice little chomp down on a Backman book was exactly what I wanted. 

Except, frustratingly, I ended up feeling a little cheapened by this book. I've loved Backman's other books (that I've read) and it's the dry humour whilst seeing there's caring a love under every grumpy character that makes their books so appealing to me.

This short story definitely tries to include that aspect, but the book is so short that it feels more like it's been _stuffed_ full of lovely sentiment to the point where it's feels more trite than anything else.

I do think it's simply the format that left this story down for me. The sentiment of the actual story is lovely (I appreciate there's no meat to my review here), but it just was blasted out of a cannon rather too quickly for my liking.
