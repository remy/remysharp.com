Light on the brain.

Just the kind of read I wanted after a few longer books. Not 100% even throughout the book - but I'll come to that.

The squirrel from the cover features a nice silly-ish part of the story where the main character will often run into a local squirrel and add his own voice in a back and forth between him and the squirrel. The sort of thing I'd expect from a Bob Mortimer book.

I'm not 100% sure where the book's tone is supposed to sit. Some parts are particularly dark - police corruption, police harassment and modern day slavery. Juxtaposed next to funny little things like socks, squeaky shoes, a cranky neighbour and dog who's constantly disappointed with our main character.

The pages did turn quickly though, and it was easy reading. Nothing particularly to shout about, but not bad either.
