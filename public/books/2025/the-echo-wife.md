Could not put the damn book down!

Very easy book to read, and annoyingly difficult to stop reading late at night.

The story is told from Evelyn's perspective, a brilliant scientist working in the field of human cloning.

There's a lot that goes on in the book, both from the story moving forward and driven by plot twists but also from Evelyn's own inner monologue.

The clone aspect of the story presents a, I think, believable take on the sci-fi concept (specifically the purpose clones would serve) and this easily leads to the messy question of what is a person, how we feel towards others, what we're willing to accept.

The book also shows how Evelyn struggles, or rather, maintains her anger and in particular, frustration towards others she feels (quite often) are incompetent, and it's interesting seeing where this comes from for the character, and how she goes on a journey, that can often get pretty dark (I'm not explaining myself well here, but I'm trying to avoid too much of a spoiler).

A very easy read for me. The story absolutely drives forward. There are lots of (I thought) nice turns of phrases throughout the book that didn't feel too forced.

There's really only one (biggish) plot hole based around the amount of time that passes, which the story does attempt to address, but I was so caught up in the page turning that it didn't particularly impair on the enjoyment.

Fun stuff!
