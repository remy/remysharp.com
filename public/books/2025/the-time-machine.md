Facinating for when it was written, but felt like it was sort of missing a _story_.

I'm definitely reading these older classics so that I acquaint myself with what I've assumed all my peers read when they were younger, so this eventually made its way into my reading list.

It's an incredible story given when it was written, late 1800s, and I can imagine it blowing minds at the time when it was read. The technicality of the book is interesting too, how there's a story inside of the story whereby the … character we're following (not narrator, but not really the protagonist) is sharing the experience with the reader. In fact, the majority of the book is a straight up monologue. Then to compound this, it's the Time Traveller (I guess the protagonist) in the present, sharing their past experience of living in the futre!

Timey wimey.

But I wasn't really expereiencing the technical feats, more following the story along, and that's where, for me, it was sort of lacking. There wasn't _really_ a story. In the sense that there were cause effect, struggles to overcome and character arcs.

The Time Traveller meets and partners with a woman in the story, but when she's taken by the Morlocks and he just… goes okay "then, I'm off.".

It's likely that I missed something in the story, but it didn't land so well for me. I think it's interesting, but I didn't come away thinking about the content of the story, the questions it could raise.

The very, _very_ end is bold, and I definitely appreciated that, but it really didn't add anything either.
