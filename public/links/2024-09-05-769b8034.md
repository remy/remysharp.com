# Ted Chaing on AI and art

I can't stop thinking about this quote from Ted Chiang (originally snipped by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/31/ted-chiang/)).

> Art is notoriously hard to define, and so are the differences between good art and bad art. But let me offer a generalization: art is something that results from making a lot of choices. \[â€¦\] to oversimplify, we can imagine that a ten-thousand-word short story requires something on the order of ten thousand choices. When you give a generative-A.I. program a prompt, you are making very few choices; if you supply a hundred-word prompt, you have made on the order of a hundred choices.
> 
> If an A.I. generates a ten-thousand-word story based on your prompt, it has to fill in for all of the choices that you are not making. There's so much push in the web development scene to use AI for jobs and my own LinkedIn feed is chock full of "AI to do X", such as generate articles, and amass content, but, as this quote so simply puts it, the actual human input is so utterly thin. To me, it makes that AI generated content unwhelming and unimpressive because it lacks so much of the individual's own input.
