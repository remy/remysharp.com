# I Will Luddite AI by Robert Kingett

A long but excellent article or even essay on AI, it's appeal to the blindness community, prompt injection, hacking and a wealth of links and well thought out discussion. Like Robert I only really learnt the real meaning of "luddite" this year, specifically because of AI, and he goes on to discuss this more, but:

> Luddites understand tech better than you and or I do because you have to know something on an intimate level to stage a coordinated push back against the particular tech. I feel like these are my people and want to actively push back against the companies in the arms race for our intimacy. Find some quiet time and read this post.
