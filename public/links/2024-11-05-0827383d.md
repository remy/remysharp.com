# Build and run online services _easily_

I find this very cool that the [Gov.uk](http://Gov.uk) / GDS have released their platform tooling (in particular _forms_) to the public sector.I can imagine it's a jump to go from project in the public sector to being able to implement all the nuts and bolts it requires, and this platform looks to cut right through the hard work. Specifically:> You can create accessible, low cost online services without needing coding skills or technical knowledge. I love this. Progressive enhancement. Core functionality (forms, payments, notifications).More background reading from their blog here: [https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/04/gov-uk-forms-in-motion/](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/04/gov-uk-forms-in-motion/)
