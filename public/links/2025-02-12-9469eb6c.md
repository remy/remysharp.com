# How to disable Google Gemini in your Google Workspace

Google's AI offering came along to paid accounts without permission or request. What made it worse is that it couldn't be turned off, whichâ€¦ I don't even have words. It was via Jan on Mastodon that I'd seen it wasn't possible to disable. But Jan having more persistance than me actually managed to find a (hidden) solution (short version, keep asking support). Bless his magnificence for getting this. I'm now Gemini-free, particularly in Gmail which was the place it was annoying me the most.
