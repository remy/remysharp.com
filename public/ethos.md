# Ethos

This just a page for things that I've collected over time. Usually it's sometime that someone else has said, but calls to me. It rings true to my ethos and existence.

It's far from definitive and not organised well, but it's a start to capture what I believe in. _This is a continuous work in progress._ And no, I don't care if you disagree with anything on this page. It's for me.

## "Agree to disagree" is reserved for things like

!["Agree to disagree" is reserved for things like "I don't like marmite." Not homophobia, transphobia, not human rights. Not basic common decency. We do not have a difference of opinion here. We have a difference in morality. Disagreeing with the validity of someone's identity and the rights and services they deserve or don't deserve because of it is discrimination, not disagreement.](/images/ethos-agree-to-disagree.jpg)

![I don't wear rainbow items to tell you who's in my bed. I wear progress queer flags so the family across the street knows they are safe. So the couple in the restaurant know they aren't alone. So the boy who sees me notice him looking at dresses knows I won't judge. I wear because you make them hide.](/images/i-dont-wear.jpg)

**This** is why I wear these colours.

> [...] I think that we have to really do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism. I think that it is the obligation of the people that have created and perpetuate and benefit from a system of oppression **to be the ones that dismantle it**, so that's on us.

## On designing the web

When thinking about creating the rules that would underlay the web:

> I had to create a system with common rules that would be acceptable to everyone. That meant, as close as possible to no rules at all.

Simplicity always wins, and stripping as much back as possible is the way to that simplicity.

## Is this the best a man can get?

I know this is (just) a marketing campaign, but it moved me to tears and I love the message it provides and it is one that I would happily play again and again in my head.

## On political correctness

A man whose words I will always have time for, Stephen Fry takes the "other side" of the argument, and articulates why he doesn't believe political correctness works. This is just a short quote from an 8 minute clip, all of which is worth watching. Interesting and refreshing views.

> My real objection is that I don't think political correctness works. I want to get to the Golden Hill, but I don't think that's the way to get there.
>
> I believe one of the greatest human failings, is to prefer to be right than to be effective, and political correctness is always obsessed with how right it is without thinking of how effective it it might be.

## Culture shifting

> This is how culture shifts work - what we are prepared to accept and call out changes over time as our community values shift more towards inclusiveness and empathy and we raise our standards for the what weâ€™re prepared to challenge or ignore.

## All that we share

In a time where higher powers are trying to convince us that we should be afraid of each other, this advert (of all things) is a beautiful remind of all that we share.

## How to be perfectly unhappy

> But those feelings are ephemeral. Being "happy" implies permanence. It implies you completed all the prerequisites. And now you get to sit atop your giant pile of happy forever.

This comic, somehow describes exactly how I've always felt about being "happy". I've never been able to say, truthfully, that I was happy. I found this <time datetime="2016-10-07 18:00:00">today</time> and it says what I've never been able to articulate.
