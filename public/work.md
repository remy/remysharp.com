### Type of work I can help you with

I've been working professionally on the web since 1999 and have a great deal of experience through experimentation, developing and deploying.

I specialise in prototype software and rapid turn around of proof-of-concept software.

I am highly skilled with JavaScript, both client side and backend (via node), and am also extremely competent with CSS and HTML, application architecture, performance, and debugging. My code is a mixture of pure JavaScript, React, Vue, static site generators and more.

I'm open to anything interesting and challenging in front-end, node.js, or mobile web.

I also run training for your developers focused around JavaScript. Details of available workshops can be found on my business web site: [Left&nbsp;Logic](http://leftlogic.com/training).

### Rate and availability

My working week is Tuesday to Friday, and for full time dev projects. For projects, I will work with you to understand the requirements and if we both believe we would make good partners for the project, I will send through a fixed quote.

I am also available for monthly retainer (please ask for details) where your team will have 24x7 access to ask me anything that can help your product.

I work remotely but am happy to visit for face-to-face meetings.

### Let's work together
